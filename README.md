# Outermost

Outermost is an experimental Full-Site Editing (FSE) WordPress theme. It is being developed by me, Nick Diego, as the base theme for all of my projects. This gives me the opportunity to continually test all of the exciting changes and new features that are coming with FSE in a live environment.

Feel free to test the theme out yourself, but remember, this is all experimental. Things will likely break with new versions of WordPress/Gutenberg. I will be continually updating the theme to keep up with all the changes, but use with caution.

## Features

* Support for a Documentation custom post type and corresponding templates.
* Custom page/post templates. Currently there are two, Freeform and Landing.
* [Trailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)-like utility classes to easily manage top and bottom margin until this functionality is added to all Core blocks in Gutenberg.
* A handful of block patterns and styles (more to come).
* Includes the Roboto Google font.
